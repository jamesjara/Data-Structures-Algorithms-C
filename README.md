Data Structures and Algorithms C

### data structure
- Interface − Each data structure has an interface.
- Implementation −  Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure.

### Characteristics of a Data Structure
- Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
- Time Complexity − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
- Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

### Execution Time Cases
- Worst Case − This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is ƒ(n) then this operation will not take more than ƒ(n) time where ƒ(n) represents function of n.
- Average Case − This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then m operations will take mƒ(n) time.
- Best Case − This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which would be maximum as ƒ(n).

### Basic Terminology
- Data − Data are values or set of values.
- Data Item − Data item refers to single unit of values.
- Group Items − Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.
- Elementary Items − Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.
- Attribute and Entity − An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.
- Entity Set − Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.
- Field − Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.
- Record − Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.
- File − File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.

### categories of algorithms 
- Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
- Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
- Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
- Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
- Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

### Characteristics of an Algorithm
- Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.
- Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.
- Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.
- Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- Feasibility − Should be feasible with the available resources.
- Independent − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.

### Asymptotic Notations
- Big Oh Notation, Ο (worst case time complexity)
- Omega notation, Ω (best case time complexity)
- Theta Notation, θ (both cases)
